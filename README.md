Report Tasks:
 - (Finshed?) Block Diagram
 - (Finshed?) Code Architecture
 - (Finshed?) Hardware Design

Hardware Parts List: 
 - Component Name (Quantity)
 1. MSP430G2553 Launchpad (1)
 2. MPU6050 Sensor (1)
 3. FIT0774 Vibration Motors (12)
 4. HD44780 LCD (1)
 5. 1 kÎ© Resistors (2)

Hardware Design:
 - The hardware setup for the project divides into 4 distinct "islands" or electronic component groupings:
   a. Island 1 --> Launchpad
   b. Island 2 --> LCD (plus potentiometer)
   c. Island 3 --> Intermediary Nodes
   d. Island 4 --> Sensor

Launchpad:
  Note: "a --> b" is equivalent to "a is directly connected to b by a physical wire"
